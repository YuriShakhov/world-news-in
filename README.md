# world-news-in

My learning project in Java/Android which uses YouTube Data API and YouTubeAndroidPlayerApi library.

WorldNewsIn App provides a list of embedded news videos. User can choose a language and customise the
news channels list. As for now, each language is linked with one single YouTube channel (e.g.
BBC News for English, DW Deutsch for German and so on).

Unfortunately, at the moment YouTube severely limits the number of search requests, so for now the
development of the application has been suspended until better times.

The part considering layout settings and video loaders is mostly based upon YouTubeAndroidAPIDemo package
downloaded from https://developers.google.com/youtube/android/player/sample-applications.
